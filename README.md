# UCR EE 213 winter 2018: Computer-Aided Electronic Circuit Simulation
This is a repository for EE213 final project.

The framework of starter-code in my work directory if forked form:  https://github.com/sheldonucr/ucr-ee213

What I do in the project:
1. Finish all parser-related files in starter-code, so that the parser can parse the input circuit and generate a pre-simulate file for Matlab for further simulation.
2. Create a MNA time-domain analysis in Matlab.
3. Create a MNA frequency-domain analysis in Matlab.


The folder of 'netlist' contains a test file.

Folder 'starter-code' contains all the execution code for paerser. Further instuction is included to run the code.

'Time analysis.zip' and 'frequency analysis.zip' are Matlab files with corresponding input data from parser. You can use your own data from parser.
